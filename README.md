# A Genetic Algorithm Solution to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem

For my bachelor's degree senior thesis, I decided to implement a genetic algorithm in Typescript that solves one of the more common variants of the vehicle routing problem.
This app uses problem instances from Set A of the [CVRP Library](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/).
